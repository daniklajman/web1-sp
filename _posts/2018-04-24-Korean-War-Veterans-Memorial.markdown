The Korean War Veterans Memorial is composed within a walled triangle which there are 19 stainless steel statues designed by Frank Gaylord. The figures represent a platoon on patrol, drawn from each branch of the armed forces; fourteen of the figures are from the U.S. Army, three are from the Marine Corps, one is a Navy Corpsman, and one is an Air Force Forward Air Observer.
